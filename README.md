#FFTW3 Go interface [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/barnex/fftw?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/barnex/fftw)   [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/barnex/fftw.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/barnex/fftw)

Go wrapper for FFTW3, with embedded FFTW source code. There is no dependency on libfftw3, you can just `go get -x github.com/barnex/fftw` (-x to show what it's doing, compilation takes long due to C files).
